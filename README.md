#DOTA 2 Replay Manager

## Current status (April 2016)
This project hasn't been in active development since Valve announced their reborn client (which included some of the features found in this replay manager).

I have not had the time to develop this actively but I may dedicate some time to updating the application if there's enough demand. I will guage interest by looking at the issue tracker (please keep discussion to issue [#27](https://github.com/d2rm/d2rm/issues/27)).

## Description

DOTA 2 Replay Manager (D2RM) is an application for Windows, Mac and Linux that lets you parse and manage your DOTA 2 replays.
It requires no sign up, displays no ads and is 100% safe.

- Mac OSX binaries are not available because I don't have access to a mac in order to rebuild some native node modules.

## How does it work?
D2RM is a program which is designed to be your own personal dotabuff replacement. 
That's right, you no longer have to share your data with 3rd party entities to access detailed statistics. Take control of your stats!
You can track multiple players, the application will first try to fetch player data using the web API and then the client if it. It can even track your own MMR!
Not only does it allow you to track multiple players' matches (yes, including pro players), it also provides you with the ability to save, manage and watch your replays!
But wait, that's not all. The best part is that it has the ability to parse your replays and provide you with detailed stats about your matches including your purchases, skill builds, gold and xp graphs and much much more.
And the best part is: it's completely FREE!

## Future Development
Future development will be dependant on your support. I would love to keep working on this application and keep improving it but I cannot do so alone without your donations.
Without donations, if you would like to contribute, feel free to make a pull request and I will gladly implement it. Other than that, I will only be fixing issues that I run across personally.
If you decide you want to release a new version based on this application I ask that you include my name (Pavel Yarmak). 
Do send me a message if you plan on working on this application as perhaps we could collaborate.
